**NeutronShield** is an InterChain DeFi Liquidation Manager designed to protect your perp positions from liquidation. This project was developed during the HackWasm 2023 hackathon in Berlin.

NeutronShield utilizes cron and interchain functions from Neutron and queries the Injective chain to monitor if a user's perp position is close to liquidation. If it is, NeutronShield smartly adds more margin into the position.

Best of all? The funds never leave the user's account on Injective. The user only provides permissions to the InterChainAccount via authz.

## üöÄ Features

- Monitors user's perp positions on the [Injective](https://injective.com/) chain.
- Adds more margin to the position if it's close to liquidation.
- Maintains the security of user's funds ‚Äì they never leave the Injective account.
- Efficient utilization of cron and interchain functions from [Neutron](https://neutron.org/).
